I was go though all source code modules. then make the optimaze in Makefiles, model relationships. after that, we can build idenepdent lib in parallel. at the same time. I was optimazed the whole EA cluster.  including the cluster manager and agent side. in cluster manager side. i was create the script to analysis log files. then i get the matrix of build type and cycle time with 100,0000 requets monthly. then i was update the policy for resource assignment and resource allocation rules. and setup the Cacti with nagios for resource usage monitor and alter.  in agent side, i was optimazed the OS/network/Applicaitons and Linux kernel for parallel task handling. Phase one. build cycle time reduced from more than 2 hours to 30 minutes. and i continue improved it in past 3 years. now. the cycle time can be controlled in 2 minutes.

I was defined the 3 level for integration and deployment pipeline. L0/L1/L2. L1 and L2 and deployment are based one this central master Jenkins. another model for L0 build. I was setup it as master only model. any new request will startup the new jenkins instance for build and unit test. the resource be released after job done. Now. all L0 jobs are configuration and deploied to Docker. and cluster are managed by ansible scripts. host are based on Vmware ESXi.
